    <h1>A fantastical adventure</h1>
      <p>
        One day, @Model.Noun and @Model.Noun2 were walking through the woods, when suddenly a giant @Model.Noun appeared. @Model.Noun cried. The two of them @Model.Verb as quickly possible, and when they were safe, @Model.Noun and @Model.Noun2 gave each other a giant @Model.Number.
