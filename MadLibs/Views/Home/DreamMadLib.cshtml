    <h1>A November Dream</h1>
      <p>
        It was a @Model.Noun November day. I woke up to the @Model.Adjective smell of @Model.Noun2 roasting in the @Model.Noun downstairs. I @Model.Verb down the stairs to see if I could help @Model.Verb the dinner. My mom said "See if @Model.Noun needs a fresh @Model.Noun2." So I carried a tray of glasses full of @Model.Noun into the room. When I got there I couldn't belive my @Model.Noun! There were @Model.Number @Model.Noun on the @Model.Noun2!
